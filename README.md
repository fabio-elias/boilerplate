  <h1>ReactJs</h1>
  <p>
    ReactJs is a powerful JavaScript library that uses server-side rendering (SSR) with a unique twist—one that allows it to provide a flexible, performance-oriented, componentized solution for the “V” in MVC (Model View Controller).
  </p>

  <h1>Webpack</h1>
  <p>
    Webpack is a module bundler. Its main purpose is to bundle JavaScript files for usage in a browser, yet it is also capable of transforming, bundling, or packaging just about any resource or asset.
  </p>

  <h1>Hot Loader</h1>
  <p>
    Hot Module Replacement (or HMR) is one of the most useful features offered by webpack. It allows all kinds of modules to be updated at runtime without the need for a full refresh.
